# AMMï¼šActive Monitoring Mechanism

The uploaded material consists of three parts, each containing our experimental data and the implementation of one of the three subject self-adaptive systems. 

Each part contains the experimental configurations we used for our evaluation and the implementation of our presented AMM approach with the subject self-adaptive system. The instructions of each implementation are shown in subfloder's README file. Considering the space limitations of this repo, we upload only five experimental configurations for each compared passive/active approach. For the all experimental configurations, we present them at the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3Q3uFJsuLBzCiuqOhcWGpaDXBOsl0Fb/view?usp=drive_link
