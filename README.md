# AMMï¼šActive Monitoring Mechanism

The uploaded material consists of three parts, each containing our experimental data and the implementation of one of the three subjective self-adaptive systems.

Each part includes the test configurations we used for our evaluation (in Test Configurations) and the implementation of the presented AMM monitoring approach with the subjective self-adaptive system. Considering the space limitations of this repo, we only upload five test configurations for each subject. For the remaining 395 test configurations, we present them at the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ov4TxClHfquCl2JBfP722-Rw5-IrC7yU/view?usp=share_link.
