# AMMï¼šActive Monitoring Mechanism

The uploaded material consists of three parts, each containing our experimental data and the implementation of one of the three subjective self-adaptive systems.

Each part contains the test configurations we used for our evaluation (in Test Configurations) and the implementation of the presented AMM monitoring approach with the subjective self-adaptive system. Considering the space limitations of this repo, we upload only five test configurations for each compared passive/active monitoring approach in the three Test Configurations folders, seperately. For the remaining 395 test configurations, we present them at the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ov4TxClHfquCl2JBfP722-Rw5-IrC7yU/view?usp=share_link.
